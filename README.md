## Hi there üëã My name is Andrei
#### About Me
I graduated from [Hexlet IT school](https://github.com/Hexlet) and now I'm looking for new career opportunities as a junior front-end developer / junior QA engineer.  
I have 16 years of experience in designing gas supply systems, of which more than 6 years were managing a project team. Since october 2022 I live in Armenia, Yerevan. I decided to change my proffesion, because I want a more stable position in a rapidly changing world, great opportunities for career growth and integration into the international community of professionals. I chose frontend development out of a desire to learn how to make user-friendly websites and dynamic applications to create a better user experience. I like to learn something new, I have an active life position, I am interested in music, cinema, reading.
